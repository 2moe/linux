# Software distribution

## Software package access

How do I go about getting a software package?

Manual compilation may be necessary for some persons.  
Because they must be highly adaptable and customisable.

> In fact, it's probably not the best choice.

In the absence of high-performance servers or PCs, "2moe" argues that a package manager based on "binary distribution" is the best solution for the average user.

Container/sandbox solutions are also useful for some specific software.
